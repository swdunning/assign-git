• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
    • A GitIgnore file is a file that specifies what files or folders we want Git 
      to ignore in our repositories.  This helps keep the repo clean from files, such as 
      setting files for IDE's that could cause issues between users.
    • The files that should be included in the GitIgnore for a Java project are 
      the .class, .project, .classpath and .settings files (.settings aren't java 
      specific though).    		


• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
    • Essentially fast-forward means that you are merging two branches and one branch is 
      behind the other branch and there is no divergent work.  Git basically moves the 
      pointer forward, meaning if Master has not diverged then git will point the master
      to the latest commit of the branch being merged into it...meaning it's being fast-
      forwarded.  


• Why should you have different branches?
    • It is important to have different branches so all contributors of a repo can work 
      in the same files and areas of code without having to constantly fix conflicts every
      time you commit code.  This also gives you the ability to keep stable code seperate 
      from broken code or in progress code.  



• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
    • Usually you would only have one remote Git repository, such as GitHub or GitLab.
      You can have backup remote repositories on a server, but typically it is just the 
      one.
